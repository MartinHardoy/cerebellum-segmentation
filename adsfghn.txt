
Cerebellum segmentantion based on active contour model


The present project is designed to perform segmentation of cerebellar structures using an active contour model called DRLSE (Li et al., 2010) from 2-D images derived from a set of DICOM images and preprocessed in a previous stage (correction of inhomogeneity of field, contrast enhancement, and anisotropic diffusion filter).
